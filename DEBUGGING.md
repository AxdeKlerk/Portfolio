## Security Error

**Bug:**  
I accidentally committed my `.env` file to **Github**, which contained my **Django** `SECRET_KEY` and **Cloudinary** API credentials. Even after adding `.env` to `.gitignore`, the secrets were still visible in the repository’s history because Git continues tracking files that were already committed before being ignored.

**Fix:**  
I permanently removed all sensitive data from Git history using the `git filter-repo` tool. The exact steps I followed were:

    git filter-repo --invert-paths --path .env

Then I force-pushed the cleaned history to overwrite the remote repository:

    git push origin main --force

After that, I confirmed `.env` was gone from **Github** but noticed that any new commits were still picking it up. I realized Git was still tracking the file locally. To stop this, I ran:

    git rm --cached .env
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking and ensure it's ignored"

Next, I regenerated new secret keys and updated my `.env` file with fresh credentials:

    python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

I also logged into **Cloudinary** to regenerate my API key and secret under “Account Details,” then updated the `.env` accordingly.

Finally, I verified the `.env` file was listed under “Untracked files” in `git status` and confirmed it was no longer visible on **Github**. 

To make sure my database wasn’t exposed either, I removed it too:

    git rm --cached db.sqlite3
    echo "*.sqlite3" >> .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Remove .env and database from repo tracking and update .gitignore"
    git push origin main --force

**Lesson Learned:**  
Once a file is committed to Git, simply adding it to `.gitignore` does not remove it from history. I learned that sensitive files like `.env` and `db.sqlite3` must be explicitly untracked and purged from the repository’s commit history. It’s also vital to regenerate new keys after exposure, since even deleted secrets in **Github** history can be recovered unless the history is fully rewritten. Now `.env` and `.sqlite3` are permanently ignored and my **Django** project is secure.
